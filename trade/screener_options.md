# Large/Mid Cap/Small Cap

When selecting option contracts, traders typically consider several key criteria to ensure they are choosing contracts that align with their trading strategy and risk profile. Here are some commonly used criteria for selecting option contracts:

1. **Liquidity**: As mentioned, high daily volume and open interest, with narrow bid-ask spreads.
2. **Implied Volatility (IV)**: Compare the option's IV to historical volatility and the IV of other strikes and expirations to gauge market sentiment.
3. **Delta**: Reflects the option's sensitivity to changes in the price of the underlying asset.
4. **Gamma**: Measures the rate of change in delta over time and is highest for at-the-money options.
5. **Theta**: Time decay factor, which is important for strategy involving time decay.
6. **Vega**: Sensitivity to changes in the IV of the underlying asset, crucial for strategies that capitalize on volatility changes.
7. **Rho**: Sensitivity to interest rate changes, which may be more relevant for long-term options.
8. **Expiration Date**: Choosing the right expiration to balance time decay and the anticipated move in the underlying.
9. **Strike Price**: Selecting in-the-money, at-the-money, or out-of-the-money options based on your outlook.
10. **Earnings and Events**: Be aware of earnings releases or other scheduled events that can cause volatility spikes.
11. **Volume/OI Ratio**: Some traders prefer options with a higher volume compared to open interest to indicate active trading.
12. **Historical Performance**: Past performance of similar option strategies on the underlying stock.
13. **Cost/Premium**: The price of the option versus the trader's budget and expected return.
14. **Underlying Stock Performance**: The trend, support, and resistance levels, and technical indicators of the underlying stock.
15. **Risk/Reward Ratio**: The potential upside compared to the potential loss of the option trade.
